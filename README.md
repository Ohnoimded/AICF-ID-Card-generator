<div align="justify">
  <p>This website serves as a straightforward platform for creating ID cards dedicated to players associated with the
  All India Chess Federation (<a href="https://aicf.in/">AICF</a>).
  These generated ID cards carry relevance for events endorsed by the AICF within India.
  An additional enhancement comes in the form of embedded QR codes, simplifying the verification process.
  These QR codes seamlessly guide users to the corresponding player information on the official AICF portal.</p>

  <p>DISCLAIMER: Please note that my expertise lies outside the realm of design. Consequently, the colors and visual appeal of both the website and the ID card might not meet expectations.</p>
</div>


<h2>Reason:</h2>
<p align="justify">The official website doesn't have a downloadable ID card for any player. It has a "Show ID" option which shows your information but it's not downloadable.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>

*   Generate AICF ID Cards
*   Easy access to AICF's website without having to leave the page
*   Verify AICF ID Cards
*   Bulk generate IDs with the built-in API
  
<h2>Website:</h2>

The website is available on <a href="https://aicf.onrender.com/">aicfidcard.cyclic.app</a>

<h2>Misc:</h2>

<p align= "justify">Identified a security vulnerability within the official website's API during the development of this platform. Evidently, the response JSON contained birth certificates for each player. 
  Reported the issue, resulting in a subsequent resolution to a certain extent.</p>
